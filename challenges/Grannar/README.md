## Solution
1. So, as the description says, we gotta find the intersecting points of two circles on a map, with radii matching the two distances.
2. We can use [this tool](https://www.mapdevelopers.com/draw-circle-tool.php?circles=%5B%5B570030%2C64.0772951%2C18.4048826%2C%22%23AAAAAA%22%2C%22%23000000%22%2C0.4%5D%2C%5B511930%2C64.9355525%2C24.8133474%2C%22%23AAAAAA%22%2C%22%23000000%22%2C0.4%5D%5D) to do this.
3. Uhh, ok, either my tool of choice sucks or this challenge is weird. Also, how am I supposed to know who lives here? Let's take a peek at the hints!
4. Alright the hints give us nothing new, let's check the intended solution...
5. Nu-uh! Nu-fucking-uh!! So, the intended solution is that the circles intersect at a CITY called "Lovisa", so the flag should be `fro{lovisa}`. First of all, no, I was told I should figure out the name of a girl, not the name of a city! Second of all, if I take a look at my plotted map there is a city not far from my intersection, but that city is named ***Loviisa***, two fucking I:s! This solution is so dumb...


## Flag
**Flag:** `fro{lovisa}`
