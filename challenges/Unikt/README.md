*Dekryptera flaggan!*

`wH~AzHhJe_c[ee~YyezVpHeG`

## Solution
1. After rambling around for a while in cyberchef I gave up and looked at the first hint. Apparently we're just supposed to brute force a key of length 2?! I reeeeaaally dont like these kinds of crypto challenges where im just supposed toI bruteforce the algorithm used AND the key... Idk, it may just be me, but I think these types of expected sollutions are stupid!
2. Let's start with the most basic then, XOR bruteforce, yeah, that gives us the flag... It's not hard, but I just dont like having to guess my way through a sollution, I really do hope that it's just me who's not competent enough to see that *"oh, obviously this string is xor:ed"* or something...
